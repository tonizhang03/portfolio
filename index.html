      <h2>About Me</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>My name is Toni Zhang. Design has been my passion since I was very young. I believe good design can bring light
        and joy to our life. In the past two years, I’ve been working at KRP Architects as an architectural designer and
        leading design teams delivering amazing products for our clients. </p>
      <p>When designing architecture, I always find myself caring more about the occupants’ living experience than other
        aspects. How do people feel living in that space has become my top priority. Then I decided to change my focus
        from designing the look of our buildings to improving the experience of our life.  After more than a year of
        study and practice, I’m now ready to start a new career as a product designer.</p>
      <p>My interdisciplinary background makes me a creative thinker and versatile maker. I’ve been working for two
        stealth startups as the lead product designer, and been designing several side projects as well. My working
        experience as an architectural designer gives me strong hands-on visual design skills. I have 10+ years of
        experience of visual design tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and basic knowledge of HTML/CSS.
        Although I studied architecture design and general management the traditional way at universities, I learned UX
        design and code on my own out of curiosity. I’ve completed the User Interface Design Specialization online
        courses by University of Minnesota, as well as other training programs of user interface design and product
        design. Having a broad interest in design and fine art, I keep hobbies such as painting, crafting, and
        photography. </p>
      <p>I appreciate tech companies that provide delightful experience to a huge amount of users. Just like Facebook
        who “gives everyone a voice”, and Google who “cares about and supports the communities where we work and live”,
        they bridge innovation with humanities. I share their value and would like to create thoughtful and meaningful
        work to the society. I believe the future belongs to new technologies that benefit our everyday life. </p>
